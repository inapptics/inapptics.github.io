  We provide two methods for integrating **Inapptics SDK** with your **iOS** app.
  
  If you are using **CocoaPods**, follow the steps in [**iOS CocoaPods Integration**](#sdkintegrationioscocoapods) section.

  If you prefer manual integration of third party SDKs, follow the steps in [**iOS Manual Integration**](#sdkintegrationiosmanual) section.

  You'll need an **App Token** in order to proceed. In case you don't have one yet, add an app [here][addnewapplink]{:target="_blank"} or get the **App Token** of your existing app [here][appslink]{:target="_blank"}.
  {: .info }

  We support apps running on **iOS 8.0** and later.
  {: .warning }

  Please note that an **App Token** can be used with a single **Bundle ID** and make sure the same **App Token** isn't used in another app/target with a different **Bundle ID**.
