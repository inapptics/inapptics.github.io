  Integrate **Inapptics** with your Slack team for essential notifications. 

  Currently the integration allows you to get **instant notifications** about new crashes in your app. The notifcation contains a direct link to the **Crash Detail** page in your **Dashboard**.

  This integration requires a Slack account and an **Inapptics** account. You can sign up for a free **Inapptics** account [here](http://app.inapptics.com/signup).

  ##### Notification

  Here is an example of a crash notification sent via Slack:

  Although crash notifications are instant, not every single crash occurrence will trigger a notification. If the same crash occurs several times, you will be notified about their **1st**, **2nd**, **3rd**, **5th**, **8th**, ... occurrences (based on **Fibonacci sequence**).
